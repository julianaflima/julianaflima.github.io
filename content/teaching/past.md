I actively seek feedback from my students with mid-semester evaluations. <a href="Mid-semester_Evaluation.pdf" target="blank">Here</a> you'll find three different mid-semester evaluations I typically give to students: a general course evaluation, a course evaluation students take right after they submit their midterm assignment without knowing their grades, and another after they get back their graded midterm. 

Here's a sample of past handouts: 

<ul>
  <li><a href="ta_ct\ta_ct.pdf" target="blank">Critical Thinking</a></li>
  <li><a href="ta_intro_to_phil\ta_intro_to_phil.pdf" target="blank">Introduction to Philosophy</a></li>
  <li><a href="ta_epistemology\ta_epistemology.pdf" target="blank">Epistemology (upper division class)</a></li>
  <li> <a href="ta_logic\ta_phil183_w13_quantifiers_kalish.pdf" target="blank"> Beginning Logic (also offered to graduate students)</a></li>
